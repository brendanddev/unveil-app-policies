/**
 * This php file implements a solution to Question 2 Part 2: Erdos-Woods Numbers.
 * Two integers are received through a POST request using the 'filter_input' function to ensure that the values are integers.
 * These two integers represent the start and the end of the sequence of numbers. The logic inside of the function is used
 * to determine if any of the numbers between the start and the end of the sequence are Erdos-Woods numbers, which for the
 * sake of the assignment is determined if any of the numbers between start and end do not share a factor with the start and end. 
 * 
 * From my understanding, the question is asking for numbers that do not share a factor with EITHER start or end.
 * If that was not the correct way of doing it, the logic can easily be changed from '||' to '&&' in order to include
 * numbers that don't share a prime factor with BOTH start and end. This is just the way I understood the question.

 $start = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'start', FILTER_VALIDATE_INT); // Ensures the input received through the POST request is a valid integer.
 $end = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'end', FILTER_VALIDATE_INT); // Ensures the input received through the POST request is a valid integer.

/** 
* This function is used to determine if any numbers between the start and end provided by the client, are erdos woods numbers.
* The function ensures that the start is larger than 0, and the end is 100 or less. The prime factors up to 47 are hardcoded into an array, 
* to speed up the process of determining factors. The prime factors of start and end will be stored in an array, and once they have been 
* determined, a boolean flag is used to indicate whether or not the number is considered a erdos woods number. Any prime factors of start 
* and end are determined, and then each number between start and end is looped through, checking if the number shares a common prime with 
* either start or end, which would not be a erdos number. Each erdos woods number is displayed in an unordered html list.
*
* @param int $start The number that begins the sequence.
* @param int $end The number that ends the sequence.
* @return void The function echos (displays) the factors.
